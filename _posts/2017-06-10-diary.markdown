this may sounds wierd. what i used to wish my children could achieve, now has gradually become my own life.

it has been a... magical shift. all in the same time realising that, all the chances are just opening, all the powers to take control of my own life has just come to its place, the newly-forged arc is just launching for its first destination, and most importantly, that instead of someone prepared, this time i am the captain.

for a long time i have been afraid and depressed, complaining about everything that happened to me, everything that i could have missed. until i found that stage has passed to somewhere completely new. here i am, being a person i never thought i could be, making decisions i have always wanted to make. it has been truly, a journey of self-rediscovery.
