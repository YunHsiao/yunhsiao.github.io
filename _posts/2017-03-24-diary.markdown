Adults. Time to time, they forget, even when it's about themselves. 

You'll find that, gradually, it's hard to remember everything.

The pain, the joyfulness, the sadness, the anger.

They all fade.

When you really look into this, it's scary, really.

What makes us, us?

Does everything that I've been through, matters?

Horrible things, exciting things, greiving things, cute little things, there are so many things that I don't want to forget, that helped make me who I am.

But they all fade. Like a distant story from someone I have not yet able to know or love.

Are those stories, memories, me?

I want them be. I love them so much, they are the rare sparkles shines beautifully in my life, even when just briefly think about them makes my stomach ache, in all the best ways.

But they all fade. Who will I be when they were all forgotten, even for myself? This fact deeply saddens me.

But only after wiping out the smiling tears with all the sorrow and ecstacy in the world, can a person understand that,

Now, is what only matters.
